## Technical Strategy

### Stage 1: Backend Strategy

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Language**: Python for main logic, Node.js for ThatOpen Components
- **Framework**: Flask for API, lightweight and fast
- **File Processing**: Streaming for large files, async operations
- **Storage**: Local filesystem with volume mounting
- **Monitoring**: File system watchers for automatic processing

#### Integration Approach
```python
# Leverage existing converter
from ifc_fragments_converter import IfcFragmentsConverter

# Wrap in API layer
@app.route('/api/convert', methods=['POST'])
def convert_file():
    converter = IfcFragmentsConverter(source_dir, target_dir)
    return converter.run()
```

#### Performance Targets
- Conversion speed: 1-2 seconds per MB of IFC data
- Memory usage: <2GB for typical models
- API response time: <200ms for file operations
- Concurrent processing: Support for 3+ simultaneous conversions

### Stage 2: Frontend Strategy

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Framework**: Vanilla TypeScript with Vite for performance
- **3D Engine**: Three.js with ThatOpen Components
- **State Management**: Simple reactive patterns
- **UI Framework**: Custom components with modern CSS

#### User Experience Design
```typescript
// Progressive loading
async loadFragment(filename: string) {
    this.showLoading(`Loading ${filename}...`);
    const model = await this.fragments.load(fragmentUrl);
    this.fitCameraToModel(model);
    this.hideLoading();
}
```

#### Interaction Patterns
- Drag-and-drop for file uploads
- Click-to-select for object interaction
- Context menus for advanced operations
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Stage 3: Containerization Strategy

#### Multi-Stage Build Approach
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Backend dependencies
FROM python:3.11-alpine AS backend-builder
# ... backend setup

# Stage 2: Frontend build
FROM node:18-alpine AS frontend-builder
# ... frontend build

# Stage 3: Production runtime
FROM python:3.11-alpine AS production
# ... combine and optimize
```

#### Deployment Philosophy
- **Portability**: Single container with all dependencies
- **Efficiency**: Alpine Linux base for minimal size
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling ready
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
